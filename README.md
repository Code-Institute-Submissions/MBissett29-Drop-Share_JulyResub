2. **Design**
  * The main aim for the design of this website was to keep it simple using very
   striking colours to make it stand out. The main colours used were orange and black.

  * The main font for this site was Rubik with the back up of sans-serif if the website 
  isnt fully able to load on certain browsers. The main reason for this choice was it looks 
  clean and concise.

  * The placeholder image used is a design of a laptop so that if a user does not chose an image, in their blog post it will default to this picture.
